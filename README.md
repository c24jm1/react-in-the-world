1. [Launch](#launch)

## Launch

Take a look at these two versions of the same website, one built using HTML and one built using React:

1. [HTML site](launch-worksheet-html.md)
2. [React site](launch-worksheet-react.md)

* What do you notice about the two sites?
* What is similar between the two?
* What is different between the two?

You may have noticed that the HTML site is made up of 3 files, whereas the React site has 4. And the code for the React site might look strange to you, but see if you can piece together how the files in the React version of the site are working together.

Now let's say you have to go in and make a change to the navigation bar on this website.

* Where in the HTML version is the navigation bar?
* Where in the React version is the navigation bar?

If you wanted to add a new item to the navigation bar:

* In how many places would you have to edit the HTML site?
* In how many places would you have to edit the React site?

Considering that many modern websites might be made up of hundreds of pages, can you start to see why React might be more useful than coding a website just using HTML?

## React in the World

React is one the most popular frameworks used today for front-end development. React was developed by Facebook to simplify the process of building a large, complex web-application.

Before we get started learning how to build our own React application, let's try and find some other website that are built with React. There are lots of lists online just like this [list of sites built with React](https://www.quora.com/Which-are-the-top-10-sites-built-with-ReactJS). Consult this list or another one like it, and see which of the sites using React.js you've used before.

Pick your favorite site you can find using React.js, visit that site, and write down your answers to these questions about the site:

1. How long did it take this site to load?
2. Facebook repeats lots of high-level elements like posts, ads, notifications, etc. Are there any repeated or similar elements on the React.js site you picked?
3. Can you click on parts of the site that change the content of the page *without* changing which page you're on?

#### Questions

* What website did you focus on?
* How quickly did your site load?
* Where there repeated or similar elements on your site?
* Did you find click interactions that didn't load new pages?
